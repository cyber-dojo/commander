The puller related issues are getting complex.

I think a better approach is to start tagging the LTF images.
Possible design...

$ cyber-dojo start-point create pp --languages \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=TAG

would be implicitly using a default of "?tag=master"
(for initial backward compatibility)
Viz the command

$ cyber-dojo start-point create pp --languages \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git

would become...

$ cyber-dojo start-point create pp --languages \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=master

Which would result in...

$ git clone \
   --single-branch \
   --depth 1 \
   --branch master \
   https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git \

But you would then progress to using explicit tags, eg, 3.7.4

$ cyber-dojo start-point create pp --languages \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4

You can check if a tag exists via...

$ git ls-remote \
    --tags \
    https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git \
    3.7.4

Note that this works for local repos too. Eg if the current dir is a git repo

$ git ls-remote --tags $PWD 3.7.4

Then it would get just that tag (git clone's --branch can take tags as well as 'master')

$ git clone \
   --single-branch \
   --depth 1 \
   --branch 3.7.4 \
   https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git \

And the [start-point create] would check its correctness as usual.

The cloned tag would contain manifest.json looking like this...
{
  "display_name": "Python (3.7.4), unittest",
  "visible_filenames": [...],
  "image_name": "cyberdojofoundation/python_unittest:3.7.4",
  ...
}

The idea is to apply immutability to LTFs just as for the services.
If and when python 3.7.5 is released you simply
o) make sure python 3.7.5 is actually inside the docker image
o) edit the manifest's display_name to (3.7.5)
o) edit the manifest's image_name tag to :3.7.5

Now you can update the master list of URLs in languages to...
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.5

And when creating a new session you will get both options in the setup
Python (3.7.4), pytest
Python (3.7.4), unittest
Python (3.7.5), pytest
Python (3.7.5), unittest

Now, existing sessions will continue to use their image:tag, eg :3.7.4
And new sessions will be using their image:tag, eg :3.7.5

This means you don't need a puller so urgently.
It becomes more likely that languages will, eg, only show a display-name
once its image is ready...(still the issue of Daemonsets on k8s though).
Perhaps it is best to just ignore puller for now.
Do pull on demand inside the runner when its the first time for the image...

Versioning issues go further...
1) what about when you update just the test-framework?
2) what about when you update just the starting files?

I think the key issue is
o) already existing sessions have their image_name:tag saved and use that
o) new sessions will use their image_name:tag

I think a good approach is

$ cyber-dojo start-point create pp --languages \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4-18

And languages contains...
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4-18

And the manifest for it is...
{
  "display_name": "Python (3.7.4), unittest",
  "visible_filenames": [...],
  "image_name": "cyberdojofoundation/python_unittest:3.7.4-18",
  ...
}

Now, if I want to make an update to, eg, just the starting files...
I make the change to the starting files.
I edit the manifest to...
{
  "display_name": "Python (3.7.4), unittest",
  "visible_filenames": [...],
  "image_name": "cyberdojofoundation/python_unittest:3.7.4-19",
  ...
}

This is committed, git tagged as 3.7.4-19 and pushed
The CI then creates a docker image tagged to 3.7.4-19

Then I update languages from...
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.3-2
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4-18
to
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.3-2
https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-unittest.git?tag=3.7.4-19

Old sessions will use 3.7.4-18 which they started with
New sessions will use 3.7.4-19
